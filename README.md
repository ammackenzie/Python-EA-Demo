# Python-EA-Demo
Python-based Evolutionary Algorithm demonstrating key EA principles and operators.

User can customise target array size *n* and algorithm will attempt to find "optimal solution" array of sorted integers of size *n*.

Algorithm allows the user to experiment with the following crossover operators:

 - Uniform Crossover
 - One-point Crossover
 - Two-point Crossover

The algorithm also demonstrates tournament selection, a standard mutation operator, as well as evaluation and replacement operators.

Code can also be easily repurposed for other integer representation based EAs such as Travelling Salesperson Problem attempts.
